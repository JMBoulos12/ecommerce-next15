## ecommerce-next15

The coding technologies used in this full-stack eCommerce project include:

## Frontend:

- Next.js 15 – Modern React framework for SSR (Server-Side Rendering) & SSG (Static Site Generation).
- React 19 – Component-based UI development.
- Tailwind CSS – Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- ShadcnUI – UI component library for modern and responsive design.

## State Management:

Zustand – Lightweight and simple state management for handling app state.

## Backend & APIs:

Next.js API Routes – Backend logic and data fetching.

## Payments & E-commerce Features:

- Stripe – Payment gateway integration for secure transactions.
- Advanced Filtering & Live Stock Updates – Likely using Next.js API or Zustand for dynamic updates.

## Deployment & Hosting:

# Likely deployed on Vercel (since Next.js is optimized for it).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
